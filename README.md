<b>Programming</b>

I started to learn programming when I was fifteen. It was vary fascinating to me. I began from C++ and tried many other technologies. I'm familiar with C++ and modern C++ 11/14. I know Python, and basic of Java and concepts conected with it. I programm on Linux and Windows and want to develop my skills. I am interested in machine learning and physics.

<b>Education</b>

At this moment I am student at the Poznan University of Technology, learning IT (third year). 

## Projects:

### Hartree-Fock-App

This is an implementation of Hartree Fock method for computation in Quantum Chemistry. My program allows to compute energies of small molecules and plots theirs orbitals.

### Neural Viewer

This app is created in .Net platform and contains my own neural network implementation. It allows to observe how neurons are activating and connections between them are changing while more and more data is given.

### Text Transformer

A Java application with simple REST api in spring, created with my colleagues as project for IT software engineering classes. It is used for text convertion.
