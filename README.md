I know Python, Java and concepts conected with it (Spring). I programm on Linux and Windows and want to develop my skills. I am interested in machine learning and physics.

<b>Education</b>

I am engineer of IT. I'm studying physics master.

## Projects:

### Hartree-Fock-App

This is an implementation of Hartree Fock method for computation in Quantum Chemistry. My program allows to compute energies of small molecules and plots theirs orbitals.

### APL

A Java application with react frontend created with my colleagues as project for IT software engineering classes. It is used for hel with learning sorting and graph algorithms.

### Neural Viewer

This app is created in .Net platform and contains my own neural network implementation. It allows to observe how neurons are activating and connections between them are changing while more and more data is given.
